<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Zongxin Liu, and welcome to my page!</p>
<p>Journeying through my youth, I have always pondered: who am I? Why am I here, ten thousand miles away from my family? Though the path toward the answer has been marked by both tears and joy, I continue to move forward, one step at a time.</p>

  I lived in China for 15 years before I came to Canada. I did well in the Chinese education system, but I felt tired and hopeless. Neither of my parents attended university; they are simple workers with high hopes of a better education for their only child. They wanted me to study abroad, but I was worried about the high expense and big risk. Once, when I was studying at school in China, one of my classmates stepped suddenly onto the window ledge and jumped without hesitation. She was a student with bright opportunities, but she ended her young life. How horrific it was! I started to question the entire system and myself: Was this the life I want? Would I be like her? Eventually, I chose to experience a new life in Canada.

  Upon my arrival in Canada, I initially shied away from social situations. However, once I gained the nerve to venture outside my comfortable solitude, my world suddenly opened up. No friends, then make friends! Not good at English, then talk to someone! Now, as a student at UA, I was the Residence Assistant at Mackenzie Hall and the Career Peer Educator at UA career center. I became the one that helps other students get adjusted to a new life and motivated to help them embrace their identities. For years, I was bullied at school because some of my traits were considered feminine. I was depressed and discouraged by my inauthentic self-expression whenever I tried to act “normal”. Finally, I realize that I don’t need any labels, I am just Galvin, a unique and strong person living life.

  Life doesn't always flow smoothly. I've faced some degressed and lonely moments which makes me feel self-conscious at times. But in those moments, I always remind myself that life is a journey of self-challenging, self-discovery, self-improvement, and self-reflection, and these challenges are exactly what make life worth living.
